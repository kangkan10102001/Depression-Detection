# Student Depression Detection System

## Overview
The **Student Depression Detection System** is an AI-driven solution designed to assess and predict signs of depression in students based on their behavioral patterns and responses. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze data and provide insights that can help in early intervention and mental health support.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Uses a dataset containing student responses to mental health questionnaires.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Analyzes text-based responses to identify sentiment and emotional cues.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implements a classification algorithm trained on labeled data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an interactive web-based interface for students to input responses.
- **Prediction and Visualization**: Displays the probability of depression severity using graphical representations.
- **Recommendation System**: Suggests mental health resources based on the detected severity level.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn
- **Natural Language Processing**: NLTK, spaCy
- **Web Framework**: Flask (for the frontend and backend integration)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Dataset
The model is trained using publicly available mental health datasets, particularly those focusing on student populations. These datasets contain survey responses with labeled depression severity levels.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/depression-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd depression-detection
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
5. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage
1. The user fills out a mental health questionnaire.
2. The system processes responses using NLP techniques.
3. The trained machine learning model predicts the probability of depression.
4. Results are displayed with severity levels and suggested mental health resources.

## Future Improvements
- Enhancing dataset quality by collecting real-world data.
- Incorporating deep learning models for improved accuracy.
- Expanding the system with multilingual support.
- Integrating with chatbot-based mental health support.
